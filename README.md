Hello!
  I'm Nicolas Gonzales. I will be joining Edward Cantu and his team as a Software Engineer Intern for Summer 2021.
  Some of my interests include Internet Software Development, as well as lower level programming and Computer Architecture.
  
  In the Fall of 2020, I took an Internet Software Development course and was hooked. I'm currently reading a few books and taking some online courses
  to further my knowledge in HTML & CSS and JavaScript. I enjoy walking my two dogs, Tex(German Shepherd) and Chloe(Terrier/Chihuahua Mix). I also like
  to brew my own beer.
  
  I'm very excited to be joining the team here at Dun & Bradstreet. I'm looking forward to not only contribute to the projects, but also learn from developers in the industry and
  listen to the wisdom they have to offer.
